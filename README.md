## Summary

Hospitals are daunting places patients of all ages, but especially for children. One way to make medical examinations less intimidating is to explain to patients what will happen. We have created an Android tablet game designed for paediatric patients of the Nuclear Medicine Department in the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital between ages of 1-10 years old. The game's purpose is to explain what will happen during an examination in the Nuclear Medicine Department.

## Libraries used:
- Scenemanager: enables the switching of scenes in the hospital
- Button: generic button class which enables multiple sprites in a button
- TextWrap: extends text functionality when presenting the dialogue
